Many of us have been missing the social nature of in-person conferences and being able to meet new people in the #NLProc research community. To remedy this, Enrico, Sarah, Peng, and Danqi, as NAACL Publicity Chairs, are starting a new series called **#PeopleOfNLProc** on the NAACL social media channels and the official conference blog (<https://2021.naacl.org/blog>)!

For the next months leading up to the NAACL 2021 conference, we will be featuring members of the NLP research community via **TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE**. Anyone is welcome to participate â€“ fill out the Google form here: <https://forms.gle/GqdiRQFTw4LaJYmG8>


Our new #PeopleofNLProc researcher is **Noah Smith** ([@nlpnoah](https://twitter.com/nlpnoah)).

**BIO:** I live in Seattle and work at the University of Washington and the Allen Institute for AI.  Some of the things I've worked on recently include:  language modeling, NLP for scientific text, evaluation, MT, and theoretical analysis of NLP models.

Which of the next 3 facts is the lie?

1. I ran a half-marathon distance one day in 2020.

2. I converted my guest bathroom to a gin distillery.

3. I performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival.
