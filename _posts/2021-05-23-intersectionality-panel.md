NAACL D&I and Vasundhara Gautam are organizing a panel to discuss the experiences of intersectionally marginalized folks in academia and tech. The discussion will draw on the panelists’ lived experiences in the context of current issues including AAPI hate, anti-trans bills, the Black Lives Matter movement, disability advocacy, hardships faced by North Africans, COVID-19, and so on. The conversation will be grounded in the framework of [intersectionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViDtnfQ9FHc) proposed by Kimberlé Crenshaw, which posits that having multiple marginalized identities can have a compounding effect on your experiences. There will be time for audience Q&A towards the end of the session.

This event is accessible to everyone, even non-NAACL participants, and will be held in the form of a Zoom webinar and will be simultaneously streamed on YouTube. There will be live ASL interpretation and closed captioning, and the panel will be recorded and uploaded to YouTube with captions afterwards.
