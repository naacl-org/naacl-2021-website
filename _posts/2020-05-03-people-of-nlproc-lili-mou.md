Many of us have been missing the social nature of in-person conferences and being able to meet new people in the #NLProc research community. To remedy this, Enrico, Sarah, Peng, and Danqi, as NAACL Publicity Chairs, are starting a new series called **#PeopleOfNLProc** on the NAACL social media channels and the official conference blog (<https://2021.naacl.org/blog>)!

For the next months leading up to the NAACL 2021 conference, we will be featuring members of the NLP research community via **TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE**. Anyone is welcome to participate â€“ fill out the Google form here: <https://forms.gle/GqdiRQFTw4LaJYmG8>


Our new #PeopleofNLProc researcher is **Lili Mou**.

**BIO:** I am an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, and I am also an Amii Fellow and CIFAR AI Chair. I obtained my BS and PhD degrees from Peking University, and did my postdoc at the University of Waterloo. I am mainly interested in machine learning approaches to NLP.

Which of the next 3 facts is the lie?

1. We admit very few grads due to funding limit.

2. My rental apartment is 2min walk from campus.

3. I did my PhD in Software Engineering Institute.
