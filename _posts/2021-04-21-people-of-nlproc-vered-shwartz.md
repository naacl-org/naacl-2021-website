Many of us have been missing the social nature of in-person conferences and being able to meet new people in the #NLProc research community. To remedy this, we are starting a new series called **#PeopleOfNLProc** on the NAACL social media channels and the official conference blog (<https://2021.naacl.org/blog>)!

For the next months leading up to the NAACL 2021 conference, we will be featuring members of the NLP research community via **TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE**. Anyone is welcome to participate -- fill out the Google form here: <https://forms.gle/GqdiRQFTw4LaJYmG8>


Our first #PeopleofNLProc researcher is **Vered Shwartz** ([@VeredShwartz](https://twitter.com/VeredShwartz)).

**BIO:** I'm a postdoc at AI2 and the University of Washington. I got my PhD from Bar-Ilan University. Besides research, I like to work out, feed birds, and listen to audiobooks. I'm interested in computational semantics and pragmatics, and commonsense reasoning. I'm currently working on learning to uncover implicit meaning, which is abundant in human speech, and on developing machines with advanced reasoning skills.

Which of the next 3 facts about Vered is the lie?

1. I did my PhD to prove to my parents that I DO finish what I start.

2. My husband and I started dating in 2004.

3. I co-authored a paper with my brother.
