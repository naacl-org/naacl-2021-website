NAACL-HLT 2019 once again features the Industry Track that was started [last year](http://naacl2018.org/chairs%20blog/2017/12/01/greetings-from-the-industry-track.html). The goal of the industry track is to provide a forum for researchers, engineers and application developers to exchange ideas, share results and discuss use cases of successful deployment of language technologies in real-world settings. 

### Industry track program

This year, the industry track program consists of three paper presentation sessions (two oral and one poster session) as well as a plenary panel discussion on Careers in NLP:

- [Careers in NLP](/program/careerspanel/) panel discussion on Monday, June 3, 13:00-14:30
- [4E: Real-world challenges](/schedule/#session-4e) on Tuesday, June 4, 9:00-10:30
- [6E: Deployed systems](/schedule/#session-6e) on Tuesday, June 4, 15:30-17:00
- [9F: Industry posters](/schedule/#session-poster-9) on Wednesday, June 5, 15:30-16:30

We  invite all NAACL participants to attend the Industry Track sessions to meet new faces, to find out what works and what doesn’t in real-life applications, and to learn about the problems you never knew existed: may be you will be the one to solve these!
