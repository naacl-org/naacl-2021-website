With the submission deadlines for NAACL 2021 colocated workshops quickly approaching, we have summarized the deadline of each workshop and organized them all by the submission date. Hopefully this would help authors determine the most suitable workshop to submit their work to, and help them plan the submission accordingly.

**Note:** All submission deadlines are 11:59PM (UTC−12), a.k.a. “Anywhere on Earth”, unless otherwise specified.
