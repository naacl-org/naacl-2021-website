**Philip Resnik** is a Professor of Linguistics at the University of Maryland, with a joint appointment at UMD's Institute for Advanced Computer Studies and an affiliate appointment in CS. He received his BSc at Harvard in 1987, his Ph.D. in CIS at UPenn in 1993, and he joined the University of Maryland faculty in 1996. His industry experience prior to entering academia includes time at BBN, IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, and Sun Microsystems Laboratories. Philip was a technical co-founder of CodeRyte (clinical NLP), lead scientist for Converseon (spearheading development of their sentiment analysis platform, now marketed as ConveyAPI), and founder of React Labs (which took a crack at commercializing his research on scalable real-time response measurement and engagement using mobile devices). He is currently an advisor to Converseon and FiscalNote (government relationship management) and co-founder of a new startup, Thematically.

**Isabelle Augenstein** is an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Computer Science, where she heads the Copenhagen Natural Language Understanding research group as well as the Natural Language Processing section. She also co-heads the research team at CheckStep Ltd, a content moderation start-up. Her main research interests are fact checking, low-resource learning and explainability.

## Mona Diab

**Mona Diab** is a researcher at Facebook AI and a professor at George Washington Unviersity. She conducts research in Statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a rapidly growing, exciting field of research in artificial intelligence and computer science. Interdisciplinarity is inherent to NLP, drawing on the fields of computer algorithms, software engineering, statistics, machine learning, linguistics, pragmatics, information technology, etc. In NLP, researchers model language and its use, and build both analytical models and predictive ones. In Professor Diab's NLP lab, they address problems in social media processing, building robust enabling technologies such as syntactic and semantic processing tools for written texts in different languages, information extraction tools for large data, multilingual processing, machine translation, and computational sociolinguistic processing. Professor Diab has a special interest in Arabic NLP, where the emphasis has been on investigating Arabic dialect processing where there are very few available automated resources.

## Jimmy Lin

**Jimmy Lin** is a Professor and the David R. Cheriton Chair in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Previously, he was at the University of Maryland. He completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT in 2004. From 2010-2012, He spent an extended sabbatical at Twitter working on services designed to identify relevant content to users (search, recommendation, etc.) and analytics infrastructure to support data science (Hadoop tools, machine learning libraries, etc.). He has also worked for Cloudera. His research aims to build tools that help users make sense of large amounts of data. He work at the intersection of information retrieval, natural language processing, and databases, with a focus on large-scale distributed algorithms and infrastructure for data analytics.

## Sebastian Ruder
