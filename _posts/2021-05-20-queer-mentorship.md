QueerInAI is launching an Undergraduate Mentorship Initiative to offer queer undergraduate students around the world help and support to pursue their academic and industry career in machine learning. The initiative will host monthly virtual sessions connecting notable academic and industry researchers with undergraduate folks. 

If you identify as queer or ally undergrad or masters student, you are welcome to join this event. You can present your work, share your experience with the audience and have interaction with others about the process of applying to graduate school, or industry job positions.

Some of the objectives we hope to achieve with this initiatives are:

*   Help queer undergraduate folks secure AI positions in academia and the industry
*   Extend our support to a broader audience of queer undergraduate students
*   Provide mental health and financial support to undergraduates
