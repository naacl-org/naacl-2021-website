Many of us have been missing the social nature of in-person conferences and being able to meet new people in the #NLProc research community. To remedy this, Enrico, Sarah, Peng, and Danqi, as NAACL Publicity Chairs, are starting a new series called **#PeopleOfNLProc** on the NAACL social media channels and the official conference blog (<https://2021.naacl.org/blog>)!

For the next months leading up to the NAACL 2021 conference, we will be featuring members of the NLP research community via **TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE**. Anyone is welcome to participate â€“ fill out the Google form here: <https://forms.gle/GqdiRQFTw4LaJYmG8>


Our new #PeopleofNLProc researcher is **Wei Coco Xu** ([@cocoweixu](https://twitter.com/cocoweixu)).

Which of the next 3 facts is the lie?

1. I wrote one of the first papers on style transfer in 2012 (<https://bit.ly/3aeNtUy>).

2. I studied CS because I lost a bet.

3. I worked hard to publish my first paper because I wanted to travel to Mexico.
